This repository contains Lean code formalising many of the proofs from 
the paper "Iterated chromatic localisation" by Nicola Bellumat and 
Neil Strickland.  Specifically, all results about the combinatorial 
homotopy of specific finite partially ordered sets have been formalised.
However, we have not attempted to formalise any of the theory of 
derivators.
